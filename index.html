          <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              FlixNET is the front end of a web application that provides users with access to a variety of information in a database of movies.
              The database is part of a REST API I built as an earlier project.  Users can create a profile, update their personal information, and add/remove movies from their list of favorites.
            </p>
          <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
            <p>
              This project was part of my curriculum at Career Foundry.  Its purpose was to help demonstrate my understanding of development using the MERN tech stack.
            </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              The objective for this project was to create a fully functional application that used the MERN tech stack.  I built the entire application from scratch, from the server-side API and business logic to the client-side user interface.
            </p>
          <h2>My Process</h2>

          </figure>
            <h4>Client-Side</h4>
              <p>
                The next step in building this application was to create the client-side and have it interact with the API.  This took me longer than I expected, partly because it was my first experience using React.  The code structure and JSX syntax took some time for me to get accustomed to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Something that I struggled with during this portion of the project was wrapping my head around application state and using props.  I used Redux for state management and while it is a powerful tool, it was very hard for me to learn.  In fact, I am still using various resources to better cement my understanding of these concepts.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Another challenge for me was trying to implement real-time form validation for the login, registration, and profile update forms.  I attempted this without using an external library.  I was able to get the form validation working, but not as well as I would like.  In fact, as a future improvement to this application I will implement this feature using the react-real-time-form-validation library.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project took me about three weeks to complete since it was my first attempt at using these libraries.

              <p>
                The first step in building this application was to create the API and database of movies.  Using JavaScript, I built a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose that fetched data from a non-relational database that I populated using MongoDB.  The API utilizes HTTP requests including; GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.  All responses are returned using JSON formatting.  While creating and testing the various endpoints and requests, I tested them using an application called <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" target="_blank" class="postLink">Postman.</a>

          <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              My main takeaway from this project was how helpful libraries like React can be when making applications with multiple pages or components.  While the learning curve was a bit steep for me, I am definitely a better developer having used it.  Although, I still have much learning to do.  In the future I would like to alter the app's layout a bit, as well as change the functionality of some links.  I'd like to refine the overall appearance of the app and implement real-time form validation as I mentioned above.
